# Image Gallery Project

This project is an image gallery created using HTML and CSS. The gallery features images displayed in grayscale, which transition to color when hovered over. Additionally, a caption appears with a smooth transition effect when the image is hovered.

## Features

- **Grayscale to Color Transition**: All images are displayed in grayscale by default. When hovered over, they transition smoothly to full color.
- **Caption with Transition**: A caption is hidden initially but becomes visible with a transition effect when the image is hovered over.
